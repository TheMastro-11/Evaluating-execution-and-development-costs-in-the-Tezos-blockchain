# Programming Languages Comparison
[Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/), [Ligo](https://tezos.com/developers/ligo/) and [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) are programming languages and toolkits for writing and deploying smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.

Some key features that these languages have in common are:

- Support for testing and debugging, including a built-in test framework and integration with popular testing tools.
- Use of common development tools and frameworks, including support for IDEs like Visual Studio Code and integration with Git and GitHub.

They all have similar capabilities but also they have slightly different syntax and toolsets.

## SmartPy
SmartPy is a comprehensive solution for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. With its easy-to-use Python syntax, developers can create contracts in a familiar and intuitive way, while SmartPy's type inference provides added safety.[[1]](#references)
It took me a long time to understand the dynamics of how a Smart Contract works on Tezos and the use of *entrypoints*. 
I was helped by:
- The use of a commonly used language (Python).
- Extensive documentation and several online tutorials.
- Great availability of the developers of SmartPy for the resolution of problems.

Once I got the hang of it, I was able to realize several use cases with little to no difficulty.  

Compared to Python, SmartPy is a strongly typed language, which can result in pros or cons depending on oneâ€™s writing method.

**Pros**:
- Possibility to keep several SCs within the same file.
- Convenience in using the *scenario*. 
- Ease in keeping the code neat, clean and understandable thanks to nomenclature, e.g.: *@sp.entry_point*, *@sp.-type-*...
- No problems when adding any implementations I wanted. 
- Python syntax.
- Well-made IDE.

**Cons**:
- Lack of *states*.


## Archetype
Archetype is an elegant generic-purpose language to develop Smart Contracts on the Tezos blockchain.
It supports all Michelson features, but also provides exclusive high-level features for a precise and concise source code, that make contracts easier to develop, read and maintain.[[2]](#references)
**Pros**:
- Good documentation. 
- A simple, readable syntax that is inspired by other popular programming languages.
- Allows the use of *states*.

**Cons**:
- Fewer developers in general and therefore less chance of finding specific support.
- Not an easy installation for the compiler (I used a GitPod workspace).


## Ligo
LIGO is a functional language designed to include the features you need while avoiding patterns that make formal verification hard. Most useful smart contracts can express their core functionality in under a thousand lines of code. This makes them a good target for formal methods, and what can't be easily proven can at least be extensively tested. The simplicity of LIGO also keeps its compiled output unbloated. Our hope is to have a simple, strongly typed language with a low footprint.[[3]](#references)

**Pros**:
- Ligo has a syntax that is inspired by OCaml, therefore it is familiar to those who already know this language. 

**Cons**:
- Difficulty in using constructs like *Option*.
- Documentation can be improved.
- Few developers.
- The several versions of this language (JsLIGO, CameLIGO, PascaLIGO and ReasonLIGO) could cause some confusion in their use.
- The system through which the *main* calls *entrypoints* is quite complex: in Ligo, a return value is always required for the entrypoints so that the operations carried inside can be transmitted to the main.
- Inability to create functions outside of the *entries* and have global variables.
