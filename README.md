# <center>LEARNING TEZOS<center>

"Learning Tezos" is a university project that aims to develop skills in the modeling and analysis of decentralized applications on the blockchain.

To this end, programming languages for smart contracts supported by the [blockchain](https://tezos.com/) will be studied.

Specifically, a set of use cases will be proposed that will be implemented in the Archetype, LIGO, and SmartPy languages, and then a report will be produced on the differences between the various implementations.
  

## USE CASES

* CrowdFunding [Link](https://github.com/TheMastro-11/LearningTezos/tree/contracts/CrowdFunding)

* (in progress)

  

## Programming Languages

[Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/), [Ligo](https://tezos.com/developers/ligo/) and [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) are a programming languages and toolkit for writing and deploying smart contracts. They are designed to be easy to use and to enable developers to write contracts that are safe, secure, and easy to understand.

Some key features of these languages include:
* A simple, readable syntax that is inspired by other popular programming languages.
* A rich set of built-in libraries and data types, including support for integers, strings, lists, tuples, records, and maps.
* Support for testing and debugging, including a built-in test framework and integration with popular testing tools.
* Integration with popular development tools and frameworks, including support for IDEs like Visual Studio Code and integration with Git and GitHub.


### Differences:
Here are some of the main differences between these three languages:

* Platform: Ligo is used for writing smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain, while Archetype is used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. SmartPy can also be used for writing smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain.

* Syntax: Ligo has a syntax that is inspired by OCaml and other functional programming languages, while Archetype has a syntax that is inspired by Python and other popular programming languages. SmartPy has a syntax that is similar to Python.

* Built-in libraries and data types: All three languages have a rich set of built-in libraries and data types, including support for integers, strings, lists, tuples, records, and maps. However, the specific set of libraries and data types available in each language may differ slightly.

* Testing and debugging: All three languages have support for testing and debugging, including built-in test frameworks and integration with popular testing tools. However, the specific set of testing and debugging tools available in each language may differ slightly.

* Development tools and frameworks: All three languages have integration with popular development tools and frameworks, including support for IDEs and integration with Git and GitHub. However, the specific set of development tools and frameworks available in each language may differ slightly.

Overall, while Ligo, Archetype, and SmartPy all have similar capabilities and are well-suited for developing smart contracts, they are designed to work with different blockchain platforms and have slightly different syntax and tool sets.
