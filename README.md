# Evaluating execution and development costs in the Tezos blockchain

The goal of this project is to evaluate the costs of developing and executing smart contracts in the [Tezos blockchain](https://tezos.com/).

Specifically:
* I have developed a set of use cases in the Archetype, LIGO, and SmartPy languages;
* I have compared the implementations in the three languages;
* Focusing on SmartPy I have [experimented](https://github.com/TheMastro-11/Evaluating-execution-and-development-costs-in-the-Tezos-blockchain/tree/main/experiments) the Smart Contract to evaluate the paid fees;
* I have developed a [tool](https://github.com/TheMastro-11/SmartContractTestScript-By-Taquito-) to automatize the estimation of the execution costs;
