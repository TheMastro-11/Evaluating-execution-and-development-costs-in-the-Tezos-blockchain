"Learning Tezos" is a university project that aims to develop skills in the modeling and analysis of decentralized applications on the blockchain.

To this end, programming languages for smart contracts supported by the [blockchain](https://tezos.com/) will be studied.

Specifically, a set of use cases will be proposed that will be implemented in the Archetype, LIGO, and SmartPy languages, and then a report will be produced on the differences between the various implementations.
  

## USE CASES

* (in progress)

  

## Programming Languages

[Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/), [Ligo](https://tezos.com/developers/ligo/) and [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) are a programming languages and toolkit for writing and deploying smart contracts. They are designed to be easy to use and to enable developers to write contracts that are safe, secure, and easy to understand.

Some key features of these languages include:
* A simple, readable syntax that is inspired by other popular programming languages.
* A rich set of built-in libraries and data types, including support for integers, strings, lists, tuples, records, and maps.
* Support for testing and debugging, including a built-in test framework and integration with popular testing tools.
* Integration with popular development tools and frameworks, including support for IDEs like Visual Studio Code and integration with Git and GitHub.
* Syntax: Ligo has a syntax that is inspired by OCaml and other functional programming languages, while SmartPy has a syntax that is similar to Python and Archetype has a syntax that is inspired by other popular programming languages.

Overall, while Ligo, Archetype, and SmartPy all have similar capabilities and are well-suited for developing smart contracts, they have slightly different syntax and tool sets.

For a detailed analysis, see the comparisons in the different use cases.
